My name is Chen, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to connect with all of you. I am a dedicated software engineer specializing in the field of robotics, with a strong passion for creating innovative solutions that push the boundaries of technology.

Currently, my work is focused on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), computer vision, and sensor fusion. These areas of expertise allow me to develop cutting-edge robotic systems that can navigate and understand their environments autonomously.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in programming languages such as C++ and Python, and become proficient in using Robot Operating System (ROS) to create complex robotic systems. My experience also extends to machine learning and deep learning, where I have utilized frameworks like PyTorch to develop algorithms that enable robots to learn and adapt to their surroundings.

I take pride in being a lifelong learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay ahead of the curve in this rapidly evolving field. As a software engineer in robotics, I am excited to contribute my expertise to projects that have the potential to revolutionize industries and improve the lives of people around the world.
